<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This plugin will validate your SQL against the ISO SQL standard. It
does this by using a Web Service provided by Mimer SQL. The SQL that is
validated is stored anonymously to be used by the ISO SQL Standards
committee.</P>

<P>For more information
on the web service consult http://sqlvalidator.mimer.com</P>

<H2>New Global Preferences Tab</H2>

<P>The Global Preferences dialog has a new &quot;SQL Validator&quot; tab.
This specifies the information to send to the Web Service. You can either
logon anonymously or use a user name and password that have been supplied
to you by Mimer SQL.</P>

<P>You can choose whether to send client details to the Web Service. If the
&quot;Anonymous Client&quot; checkbox is unchecked then the Client and
Version details shown will be sent to the Web Service along with your
validation request otherwise &quot;N/A&quot; will be sent for these
fields.</P>

<P>The &quot;Show Confirmation Dialog&quot; checkbox, if checked, will display
a confirmation dialog prior to sending the validation request to the web
service.</P>

<H2>New Menu Items</H2>

<P>A &quot;Validate SQL&quot; item has been added to the &quot;Session&quot;
menu. When selected this will attempt to validate the current SQL in the
SQL entry area. If &quot;Show Confirmation Dialog&quot; was specified in the
&quot;SQL Validator&quot tab in the Global Preferences dialog then a
confirmation dialog will be shown otherwise the validation request will be
sent to the web service.</P>

<P>Results are shown in the message area at the bottom of the session window.</P>
